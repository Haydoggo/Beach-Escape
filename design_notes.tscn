text = "Player Units
- Fish: small, weak, walks in a straight line and deals small damage. Kind of like a bullet?
- Crab: bigger, slower, walks in a zig zag, deals adjacent damage
- Urchin: moves slowly, straight line, high damage aoe. Kind of like a bomb?
- Shark: typically 1-use, but does a ton of damage, moves fast, and moves through towers
- Octopus: When this creature moves into the space of a tower, it will prevent the tower from shooting for a period of time.
- Pufferfish: When a tower hits this fish, they will puff up, stopping them but causing them to take significantly less damage.

Enemy Units / Defenses
- Sand Cannon: points in one direction, deals big damage
- Pit: a hole, can be filled with units 
- Tack shooter: Aoe tower (oh it's also sand) 
- Seagull: Flies back and forth between two locations on the grid, and attacks whatever is in front of it for significant damage. If it kills a creature, it will fly away with it.
- Pelican: Will consume a fish instantly, preventing the fish from moving (or drying out). After a certain amount of time, the fish will break out and continue moving, having been damaged significantly 
- Jellyfish: When a fish moves into a tile with a dead jellyfish on it, they will take damage and move slower for a period of time.
- Shovel: Faces toward the castle; when a fish moves in front of it, it launches them a few tiles toward the castle, messing up their pathing."

text = "REVERSE TOWER-DEFENSE GAME:

You are a group of sea creatures in a sand castle undergoing a siege by a human. Your objective is to get the sea creatures out of the castle, which have various movement patterns that must be accommodated for. In your way are various human-made towers (siege weapons, etc), which 1. can rotate (not always?), 2. have limited ammunition (not always?), and 3. have variable attack patterns (range, area, firing speed, damage, etc)."
